# BASIC-IMAGE-PROCESSING
This is a repository for fundamental image processing techniques using Python. This repo covers essential operations like image filtering, transformations, edge detection, and color manipulations using OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL.
🚀 Features

📌 Reading & Displaying Images – Load images from disk and display them.

🎨 Color Space Conversion – Convert images to grayscale, RGB, HSV, etc.

🔍 Filtering & Smoothing – Apply Gaussian blur, median filter, and sharpening.

🔄 Geometric Transformations – Resize, rotate, flip, and crop images.

✂️ Edge Detection – Use Canny, Sobel, and Laplacian filters for edge detection.

📊 Histogram Equalization – Improve contrast using histogram manipulation.

🖍️ Drawing on Images – Add shapes, text, and lines to images.

🏗 Morphological Operations – Apply erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.
